# UK SOC Task intensities

This repository contains the **task intensities** (manual, routine, cognitive) of occupations in the UK. It is available for SOC 1990 and SOC 2000. 

The task intensities were obtained from Dorn (2009), which are computed for the United States's 1990 occupational classification. The analysis required a mapping (crosswalk) between US 1990's occupation classification and UK's SOC 1990 and 2000. Such crosswalks are also available here.

## Files included

- occ1990dd_soc2000_crosswalk.dta: Stata file containing a crosswalk between occ1990dd (as presented in Dorn, 2009) and UK SOC2000 (4 digit level).	

- soc1990_task_intensity.dta: Stata file containing the task intensity of UK SOC1990 codes (3 digit level), derived as explained in Valenzuela (2018) 

- soc2000_task_intensity.dta: Stata file containing the task intensity of UK SOC2000 codes (4 digit level), derived as explained in Valenzuela (2018)
