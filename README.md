UK SOC Task intensities

This repository contains the Task intensities (manual, routine, cognitive) of occupations in the UK. It is available for SOC 1990 and SOC 2000. 

The task intensities were obtained from Dorn (2009), computed for the United States's 1990 occupational classification. Therefore, the analysis required a mapping (crosswalk) between US 1990's occupation classification and UK's SOC 1990 and 2000. Such crosswalks are also included here.
